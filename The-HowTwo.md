# How to approach females as good person in hopefully good order

## Check your room
 * Does it look like living space or a pile of old mess or is it a dark cave with mould or a trash bag or a scrape-yard? Is that where the girl want to flourish? Will she want to return to that place? If not, take some time to clean that up. And spice it up with some flower perhaps.
 * Do you tend to leave mess on public places? If so then fix it as soon as possible.

## Check yourself.
 * Be honest to yourself and to the others.
 * Pay your dues. Another borrowing won't patch the dept black-hole. Perhaps seek some professional advisor before it is too late!
 * Check your body and posture. Are you healthy? Are you overweight or does some part of you look weak? You should fix yourself.
 * Does your dress represent who you really are or at least who you want to be? Is it intentional that the top doesn't match the bottom or left the right? Symmetries matter man!
 * Are you in a good mood? Don't pull the girl down with you.
 * Check your shoes as well. Are they dirty? Girls are checking the shoes for some reason.
 * Do you smell without a deodorant or antiperspirant? People tend to not smell themselves. If your diet is spicy or perhaps unbalanced, you may need to spice you up wit some cologne or in worst case a spray.

## Check the girl
 * Does she look healthy to you? If not, can you help her? If yes, it is a plus for you!
 * Is she married or did come with some other guy? If so, you might be on very dangerous road. Pick other woman. Ask if unsure make yourself sure before you commit to someting with her.
  * The wedding ring can be on right or left hand depending on religion or national customs.
  * Remember the state of the girl. If you were to leave her, which happens and you have to be strong enough to handle this, make your best to return her in better condition then you found her. 
  * Is she a good match? You did look on yourself did you? So think about it.

## Do you have something to offer?
 * Again, are you in good mood? If not practice with sister, mamas, grandmamas, aunts, other random people. Don't worry, you can do it.
 * Start a conversation with her. It is hard to start a converation when you are not used to that. Practice with your friends, old ladies, mamas, sisters. You can do it!
 * Start doing something for the others so you have something to talk about.
 * Start dancing. It will help you with many things written in here.
 * Start or be part of some active healthy community. Again something that will help.

## Take action!
 * This is important! You need to make the move. Man has to take action. That is what is atractive on him.
 * Learn how to flirt. Google is your friend.
 * Start the conversation. Keep conversation going but let the girl talk. Don't interrupt. Girls like to talk. Listen what she says so you can react. Don't over-argue.
 * Take responsibility for your actions.
 
## Improve yourself.
 * If you are a mess or missed a point, I bet you can make this world better. Just do it and then please CHECK FOR MISTAKES, COMMIT, SHARE and LEARN
 * Repeat from the begining and you will learn something (:
